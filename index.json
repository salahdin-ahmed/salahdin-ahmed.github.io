Start every morning with talking to death, plan your day as if it is with you, and sleep every night while perceiving it. Do not forget him since he will not forget you. We forget death, and then it takes us without noticing. Remind yourself of it every day, week, month, and year; every happiness and every sadness; every instance of realization; and even when you are not conscious. Treat death as it is and treat it as a fact, which having emotions towards becomes meaningless. Just remind yourself of it so whenever it strikes it is no surprises.\nNonetheless, there are some who try to make it a happy thing. They bring up all the good deeds it does to the human civilisation. The death of the corrupted, greedy, and evil are all because of it. Maybe having a long, even forever, life is meaningless. Its absence may bring us more problems than its presence. All are nothing but lame excuses to convince the weak human self that death is okay.\nIn contrast, some will hate it and try to work against it. They will hate it from the deepest guts of their mortal bod. Their hatred will be the fuel to the seeking of death elimination, a goal too far to be reached. A great example is The Fable of the Dragon-Tyrant in which death is fought and won against. Nevertheless, it is not more than a mere story that represents the fatuous desires of mere humans. In reality the experiment against the death would fail and we will be doomed by the monster created by our own hands.\nJust accept death as what it is: an incomprehensible fact. Perhaps the improvements of one\u0026rsquo;s own life is a great goal, yet the notion of immortality is the most malignant.\n","date":"August 20, 2022","hero":"/images/posts/writing-posts/death-hero.png","permalink":"https://salastro.github.io/posts/philosophy/death/","summary":"Death, the most detested of the experience (i.e. life) from the majority of whom endure.

He insisted that area is a scalar, while some of us were totally convinced that it should be a vector. I, personally, was on the scalar side since vectors always have a direction, and area can not have such a characteristic. The only vector related to area is the normal to its surface, which is looked to me as a completely separate thing from area itself. It may be attached to it, but it is not what defines it.\nHowever, now, my understanding of physics has changed a little. My current understanding of physics — and natural sciences in general — is that they are just models with the whole purpose of making it easier to understand, predict, and benefit from natural phenomena. Based on this definition of science itself, what we call vector and scalar are only abstract concepts we, humans, have created to facilitate analyzing physical systems; they do not relate whatsoever to the true nature of the object or quantity. Thus, questions about the relation of these abstractions with the observable real-life entities become less meaningful. These questions should instead be on how much does this specific abstraction benefit us in different cases.\nSo the question “Is area a vector or scalar?” becomes “Which could help us more? A vector or scalar area?”. This is way more approachable than the previous question and answering will be quite handy in actual problems instead of the philosophical perspective that we view nature with. It is not hard at all to answer this question, it just depends on the frame you are working in. That is, what I believe to be, the soul of science itself: to describe the unpredictable by our limited minds with the easiest possible approach, both computationally and intuitively.\nIf you deal with vector flows and fluxes that go through areas, and you calculate the final effect on area (or after passing through it), then it definitely helps to have a vector area; it makes many of the calculations you have to do a cross product of the quantity with a vector with the direction of the normal of the surface with a magnitude that of area. If we try to treat area as a scalar only in these cases it will be hell for us since we now have to write all equations with area and the sin of the angle between the normal of the surface and the vector quantity, both hard to write and read. This becomes crystal clear in electromagnetic systems. You always have some kind of flux being measured through some kind of area. You don’t have the time to get the angle of the surface with an axis, do you? Just cross product instead!\nIn contrast, there are countless simple systems where areas are no more than a straightforward multiplication with other quantities. It may not be the general formula for every case that is similar to this system, but it does the job for most day-to-day cases. There is no need to make area a vector when measuring the pressure of a gas on a cube. Like you would not prefer using a vector area when analyzing a fluid’s flow around a sphere. It would be a pain to think of the equations as a cross-product of vectors since they cancel into simple scalars anyway. What would you need angles and cross products for? Measuring the unmeasured angles?\nTo conclude, we can learn from this that context is the thing that really matters most of the time. Our mechanics teacher worked mostly on cases in which scalar area makes the most sense. Additionally, his strong pure mathematical background made him extend the — arguable — perfectionism and idealism of mathematics to the human-made physical models of the real world. This resulted in his certainty about his point. In his context, vectorized area means nothing, which is not a bad thing. We, as a society, should always recognize the difference in the correct points of view. It is possible, although hard, for us to accept the existence of different points of view. However, it is usually over one’s head to deeply realize the contextual correctness of other ideas that you may — currently — disagree with.\n","date":"April 1, 2022","hero":"/images/posts/writing-posts/area-hero.jpg","permalink":"https://salastro.github.io/posts/physics/area/","summary":"In grade 10 we had a discussion with our mechanics and mathematics teacher about how should area be described.

We don\u0026rsquo;t really engage, have fun, or learn. You waste hours of your life doing nothing but scroll through an endless stream of meaningless content. Human lives should be wasted on nothing like this. I won\u0026rsquo;t be talking about why to leave, you are here because you already want to leave.\nWhy it\u0026rsquo;s so hard to leave It is no secret that social media companies improve their products every single day. A part of this improvement is the time consumed on their platform, which results in the countless hours the average social media user waste on these places. Their goal is to make you always use their product, no matter your mental state. You are happy? Let\u0026rsquo;s share your happiness with the world! Sad? Let\u0026rsquo;s browse whatever may make you happy! And the list goes on. We are weak humans with powerful lusts controlling us against huge corporates searching for everything in human nature to exploit it for their benefit, which is, unfortunately, is harmful to us in this case.\nWhat we should do The approach I use depends on the fundamental idea that humans have no self-control. The only thing that may prevent us from harming ourselves is how hard it is. Thus, we shouldn\u0026rsquo;t try to stop using social media; we should make every social media platform we use unusable. The notion of having willpower that could move the mountains is — more often than not — a fantasy. Humans weren\u0026rsquo;t created to do the hardest thing in front of them, quite the opposite, the easiest possible thing they could think of. Conserving energy was the way to go for survival for cavemen, so we were created to choose the path that requires the least amount of energy. However, modern life requires a lot of energy wasted on things that cavemen are were not used to, and here the conflict arises between our conscious mind and our primal brain.\nFortunately, modern humans have many ways to surpass our biological limits, and our struggle with self-control is no exception; I would recommend the book that I am currently reading Atomic Habits since it tackles this aspect of human nature heavily. A rule of thumb for modern humans, who seem to be disciplined, is eliminating whatever stands in their way. We can\u0026rsquo;t just have temptations hanging onto our eyes and ignore them. Therefore, we just have to make it impossible to use social media during our day-to-day life.\nWe can\u0026rsquo;t delete them It is not like corporates don\u0026rsquo;t know that they make our lives worse. They know, and they know some will try to stop using their platforms, so they made it harder to stop using their platform. Every lost user means less money. If you try deactivating your Facebook account before, you would notice it is pretty much useless, no change actually happened since you can as easily open it again. Even the complete deletion of your account needs 30 days to be done, which is a rather long time for a decision like this. The same for every other major social media platform. They can\u0026rsquo;t lose you, the dear valuable user.\nAdditionally, many people have some legit uses for social media. It is just sometimes unrepeatable. In these cases, just the idea of deleting them is not practical. Maybe you tried plugins like News Feed Eradicator or DF YouTube that hindered your harmful use of social media for a while, but after some time you have just disabled them. These plugins just add a layer of resistance but do not eliminate the use, which is better than nothing but certainly not the solution.\nMy solution Based on what I have already mentioned, my solution was rather simple. Make social media as unusable as possible. I will talk about how I did this with Facebook and then you can apply similar stuff to other social media platforms. Because they all are the same in core, it won\u0026rsquo;t be that hard to apply the same strategies to most of them. Maybe you feel this is a little bit overwhelming; if you can\u0026rsquo;t even start anything about it, just delete the apps from your phone, this will increase the friction and this will be enough for a couple of days.\nThe main problem with Facebook is the feed of entities you follow. You won\u0026rsquo;t be wasting that much time on Facebook if there was no newsfeed, would you? Thus, the solution was to unfollow everyone on Facebook. This may have been tedious if not for the fact we can automate everything we can think of. This GitHub gist will help you unfollow all the shit you follow on Facebook. To open the console press CTRL+SHIFT+I and use the latest code found (at the end of the page) since it is the one probably working. It is advised to read the script that you are running and actually understand it, don\u0026rsquo;t just listen to whatever people tell you (including me). After this, you would literally be unable to use Facebook the way you used to. Your newsfeed would be empty of anything, and you won\u0026rsquo;t be able to follow all the things that you used to since they are just too many and you already don\u0026rsquo;t remember half of them. Now, when you open Facebook you would find nothing to do and close it after a couple of minutes instead of a couple of hours.\nHowever, there are some platforms where your main feed isn\u0026rsquo;t who you follow, it is what the algorithm recommends. In this case, things are a little bit tricker, just unfollowing/unsubscribing to everything won\u0026rsquo;t cut it. Here, the only two solutions are to either make it as hard as possible or just delete them. This was what I have done with Instagram and YouTube. I have just deleted my Instagram account (and somehow it was immediately deleted), uninstalled it, and after some time (when I was sure that my addiction has gone for good), created a new one. Now, I rarely use it and only open it from the browser on my desktop, which isn\u0026rsquo;t the nicest experience to have. The same for YouTube, just delete your channel, all of your watch history, and thus your recommendations, are in your channel, not your account. This would make your recommendations duller, and ultimately making the experience way more much undesirable without deleting the undeletable super important Google account. Just don\u0026rsquo;t forget to also disable the watch and search history, or otherwise, YouTube will recommend you the same stuff as before after some time. After some time, I found using YouTube from mobile got really uninteresting, and I deactivated the application without looking back. If there is something that I really need to search on YouTube, then opening it from the browser is just fine.\nRecommendations Other things I have heard but did not try myself that I think may also work:-\nGiving the passwords of your social media accounts to a trusted person and telling them to change the passwords; you will have to actively tell the person to give you the password, which will make it much harder. Make a different account on your system with your social media accounts logged in and log out from your main work account and delete the passwords (have a password only available on the social media account to access them), this will make you consciously choose to open social media and stop working by restarting the machine.

It mainly follows an array paradigm, unlike the usual functional and object-oriented approaches; it depends heavily on weird mathematical glyphs; and it is surprisingly elegant.\nHistory of Old Wizardy APL is a quite old language. It started as a book (under the same name) written by Kenneth Eugene Iverson in 1962. The focus of the book was mathematical notation. Ken was dissatisfied with the inconsistency of mathematical notation and the lack of a sufficient tool to describe computer algorithms especially when it comes to matrices. Thus, he created what he later won a Turing Award for.\nThe notation was used inside IBM (his workplace) for describing some reports. However, the first interpreter was not built until a year later for limited use. On the other hand, the first commercially available one was introduced in 1968. After that, APL started gaining popularity from the late 1960s till the early 1980s.\nIn contrast, these days APL is not as popular as it used to be. Despite that, development is still going. The most popular implementation of APL is Dyalog, a commercial implementation started in 1983 (yes, even the most modern of implementations is on the old side) that in recent years added useful extensions like object-oriented and functional programming, nested arrays, lambda calculus, etc. Additionally, if you are not a fan of commercial restricted use, you may try GNU APL but with fewer extensions.\nScripts of Magic As mentioned before, APL uses a unique combination of mathematical symbols. These symbols represent polymorphic functions used to tackle a variety of problems. For example, the symbol ⌈ behaves as celling when a single integer is passed to it and as maximum when two numbers are passed to it. In addition, the symbol for the exact opposite behavior is ⌊ resulting in beautiful symmetry.\n⌈ 2.4 3 4 ⌈ 2 4 Yet, the elegancy does not stop there. The circle symbol represents the Pi constant multiplies while also behaving as trig functions.\n○1 3.141592654 2○○1 ¯1 ¯2○¯1 3.141592654 This is the case with most of the functions in APL. They consist of weird glyphs. This may seem intimidating at first glance, and it is for people that aren\u0026rsquo;t comfortable with APL\u0026rsquo;s syntax. However, it makes it much easier to look at huger chunks of logic. An impressive example is an implementation of Conway\u0026rsquo;s Game of Life, where you can see all the important logic in one line of magic. This makes many things way more elegant in some way.\nLife ← {↑1 ⍵∨.∧3 4=+/,¯1 0 1∘.⊖¯1 0 1∘.⌽⊂⍵} Simple Array Logic A fascinating aspect of APL is the way it handles arrays. It just works exactly how I expect it to work. First off, there is no special syntax to write arrays, they are just numbers/string separated with spaces. 1 4 3 is an array of three elements: 1, 4, and 3. 'hello' 'world' is an array of two elements: \u0026lsquo;hello\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;world\u0026rsquo;. On the other hand, operations also makes sense. 1 2 3 + 4 5 6 sums the two arrays into 5 7 9, which is exactly what I thought of the first time I saw a plus between two arrays. You want to sum the elements of the array? No problem just add +/ in front of the array, and it is done. A running sum? Just replace the / with \\. More stuff like Cartesian product are also simple; just insert ∘., between the two arrays. This partially extends to strings since they also are arrays but of characters.\nComparison Generally, APL solutions to algorithmic problems involving arrays in some form are much cleaner than other programming language. This is, however, not a perk of APL into itself since most array programming languages (and to a lesser extent functional ones) yields the same force of minimal simple solutions.\nProblem APL Python LeetCode #1920 ⊂⌷⊢ [nums[i] for i in nums] LeetCode #1979 ⌈/∨⌊/ math.gcd(min(nums), max(nums)) LeetCode #1614 ⌈/+\\(⊣-~)'('=(s∊'()')/s max(itertools.accumulate(filter(None, map({\u0026quot;(\u0026quot;: 1, \u0026quot;)\u0026quot;: -1}.get, s))), default=0) LeetCode #14 {+/∧\\(⊃∧.=⊢)¨↓⍉↑⍵}↑⊃ ''.join(x[0] for x in itertools.takewhile(more_itertools.all_equal, zip(*words))) However, it is important to realize that this is not always the case; it is completely possible to write ugly code in APL that could have been written better in other traditional programming languages. It basically depend on the problem and the approach.\nFor Future Wizards Try APL online Learn APL Book APL Wiki Download Dyalog APL Dyalog Usermeeting YT channel Rodrigo Girão Serrão YT channel (solves LeetCode problems with APL) code_report YT channel (cool person who talks about array programming) APL subreddit APL demonstration 1975 ","date":"February 20, 2022","hero":"/images/posts/writing-posts/apl-hero.jpg","permalink":"https://salastro.github.io/posts/programming/apl/","summary":"APL (A Programming Language) is an exceptionally unique language.

For the most part, Linux distributions follows the Unix philosophy and are Unix-like operating systems.\nDistro is just a shorthand for distribution!\nDoes it even matter So little, most things that can be done on Linux can be done on all distros. Distros are more of an entry point, how you would like your system to look like when you start using it. Just do not think about it too much and decide after reading this post.\nWhat is your distro I divide Linux distributions into two main categories: basic and advanced. Basic are just user-friendly distros, while advanced are distros for tech-savvy people. In addition, deciding, what I call, sub-family is important. This is just a term I use to refer to the main distros and the distros that are build on top of them. For example, Ubuntu is based on Debian, so it is in the Debian sub-family and Manjaro is based on Arch, so it belongs to the Arch sub-family. The most popular sub-families are Debian and Arch, so we will mainly take about distros in their domain.\nBasic 1. Ubuntu The most popular easy-to-use distro. Basically what you want to use if you want something fresh and easy.\nDebian based One of the most popular distros Easy to use Not windows-friendly GUI compatible with touch devices Contains, in my opinion, a lot of unneeded heavy programs (may not work efficiently with older hardware), but works most of the time nevertheless Supports many of the closed-source software 2. Mint A popular easy-to-use distro. Basically what you want to use if you want something similar to windows, easy, and efficient.\nDebian based Popular Easy to use Windows-friendly Many GUIs to choose from (XFCE, cinamon, etc) Does not contain a lot of unnecessary programs 3. Manjaro A less popular advanced yet easy-to-use distro. Basically what you want to use if plan to upgrade to a more complex system later.\nArch based Popular enough to find support most of the time Huge community support (especially through the AUR) Easy to use-ish yet advanced Many GUIs to choose from Minimal in some aspects but bloated in others Advanced Note that if you do not have enough knowledge, you may get stuck with a black screen when dealing with advanced distros. They require you to setup most parts and customize everything to your liking.\n1. Debian THE most popular distro Customizable Largest number of packages. 2. Arch Advanced Customizable Bloated in many ways. Huge community support. BOUNCE: You can say \u0026ldquo;I use arch btw\u0026rdquo; and Linux users will laugh.\n3. Void Advanced Customizable Minimal Lacks community support. 4. Gentoo The most advanced and customizable, you can basically do whatever you want with it Compile everything from source with an advanced package manager.
