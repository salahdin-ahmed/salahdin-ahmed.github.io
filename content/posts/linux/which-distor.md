# Introduction
## What is a Linux distribution 
Linux distributions usually refers to a family of operating systems that uses the Linux kernel and are similar in some design aspects. For the most part, Linux distributions follows the Unix philosophy and are Unix-like operating systems.

**Distro is just a shorthand for distribution!**
## Does it even matter
So little, most things that can be done on Linux can be done on all distros. Distros are more of an entry point, how you would like your system to look like when you start using it. Just do not think about it too much and decide after reading this post.

# What is your distro

I divide Linux distributions into two main categories: basic and advanced.
Basic are just user-friendly distros, while advanced are distros for tech-savvy people.
In addition, deciding, what I call, sub-family is important. This is just a term I use to refer to the main distros and the distros that are build on top of them. For example, Ubuntu is based on Debian, so it is in the Debian sub-family and Manjaro is based on Arch, so it belongs to the Arch sub-family. The most popular sub-families are Debian and Arch, so we will mainly take about distros in their domain.

## Basic

### 1. Ubuntu
The most popular easy-to-use distro. Basically what you want to use if you want something fresh and easy.
- Debian based
- One of the most popular distros 
- Easy to use
- Not windows-friendly
- GUI compatible with touch devices
- Contains, in my opinion, a lot of unneeded heavy programs (may not work efficiently with **older** hardware), but works most of the time nevertheless
- Supports many of the closed-source software

### 2. Mint
A popular easy-to-use distro. Basically what you want to use if you want something similar to windows, easy, and efficient.
- Debian based
- Popular
- Easy to use
- Windows-friendly
- Many GUIs to choose from (XFCE, cinamon, etc)
- Does not contain a lot of unnecessary programs

### 3. Manjaro
A less popular advanced yet easy-to-use distro. Basically what you want to use if plan to upgrade to a more complex system later.
- Arch based
- Popular enough to find support most of the time
- Huge community support (especially through the AUR)
- Easy to use-ish yet advanced
- Many GUIs to choose from
- Minimal in some aspects but bloated in others

## Advanced

Note that if you do not have enough knowledge, you may get stuck with a black screen when dealing with advanced distros. They require you to setup most parts and customize everything to your liking.

### 1. Debian 
- **THE** most popular distro
- Customizable
- Largest number of packages.

### 2. Arch
- Advanced 
- Customizable
- Bloated in many ways. Huge community support.

**BOUNCE:** *You can say "I use arch btw" and Linux users will laugh.*

### 3. Void
- Advanced
- Customizable
- Minimal 
- Lacks community support.

### 4. Gentoo
- The most advanced and customizable, you can basically do whatever you want with it
- Compile everything from source with an advanced package manager.

# Conclusion

That was it, choose the distro rn based on the information I have given you and don't think about it too much. Choose now, regret later!
