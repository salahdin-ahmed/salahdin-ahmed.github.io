Death, the most detested of the experience (i.e. life) from the majority of whom
endure. People hate, avoid, and even fight it, but no matter the struggle with
that edifice, it will devour you and everyone close to your heart. You will
have—even if you hate to—accept it.

My philosophy, on the other hand, is to embrace it; make it an irreplaceable
ingredient in your daily life. Start every morning with talking to death, plan
your day as if it is with you, and sleep every night while perceiving it. Do not
forget him since he will not forget you. We forget death, and then it takes us
without noticing. Remind yourself of it every day, week, month, and year; every
happiness and every sadness; every instance of realization; and even when you
are not conscious. Treat death as it is and treat it as a fact, which having
emotions towards becomes meaningless. Just remind yourself of it so whenever it
strikes it is no surprises.

Nonetheless, there are some who try to make it a happy thing. They bring up all
the good deeds it does to the human civilisation. The death of the corrupted,
greedy, and evil are all because of it. Maybe having a long, even forever, life
is meaningless. Its absence may bring us more problems than its presence. All
are nothing but lame excuses to convince the weak human self that death is okay.

In contrast, some will hate it and try to work against it. They will hate it
from the deepest guts of their mortal bod. Their hatred will be the fuel to the
seeking of death elimination, a goal too far to be reached. A great example is
[The Fable of the Dragon-Tyrant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fable_of_the_Dragon-Tyrant)
in which death is fought and won against. Nevertheless, it is not more than a
mere story that represents the fatuous desires of mere humans. In reality the
experiment against the death would fail and we will be doomed by the monster
created by our own hands.

Just accept death as what it is: *an incomprehensible fact.* Perhaps the
improvements of one's own life is a great goal, yet the notion of immortality is
the most malignant.
