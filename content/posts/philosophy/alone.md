The thought that hunts those who think of us the most is being of a
something greater than ours. It is the search for the meaning that we
crave for to fulfil our existence in life. We aim for something other
than the manifestation that we acquire because of our realization of
its incompleteness. Even the most narcissistic of us seek in similar
vain. I may even argue that the only difference between who were
deemed sane and those who are not is a corruption in the essence of
meaning. For example, narcissists think that they can be of everything
without paying pain and guts.

The thing that we rarely realize, however, is that we will never
become truly of something more significant. We cannot be beyond the
existence we already are. Elaborating, we cannot change this essence
by an inch. Yes, we do change some of its physical manifestations,
even when they affect our own perspective on the world, but we cannot
change what we are inside. Only the behavioral patterns, recognition
patterns, problem sets, etc. Even on a physical level, we never
increase our physical occupation of self. The only aspect that may
give us such a feeling is the mental distortion of our conceptual
model.

It may seem to some that the significance they seek is becoming an
irreplaceable part of their essence, but, through experience, it can
be proved otherwise. Some, despite that, may go to the lengths of
calling it their true self, existence, manifestation, or whatever new
buzz word they use to represent some notion about their self.

I, in contrast, would argue that we are forever alone, never becoming
something more than what we were born with, not the genetic traits we
inherent, but the metaphysical spiritual ethos that we have. The
limits of the concept and physical are defining our boundaries within
the reality, and the *spirit* does not grow beyond.

This structural model, however, is not to be depressed from because
what lose do we get when we are nothing but ourselves, none. Some may
even argue that we free ourselves from the limits of whatever chains
shall be put by whomever can be, although I may disagree to some
degree with that specific claim by these specific people. Freedom from
every single little detail of our the limitations beyond ours is not
specifically a good thing. It, onto itself, may bring many sufferings:
maybe it was not chains of prison but chains of protection. On the
other hand, my own way to see this is that it is the freedom of
suffering. After all, what to be suffered about in such a case, not
much.
