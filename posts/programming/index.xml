It mainly follows an array paradigm, unlike the usual functional and object-oriented approaches; it depends heavily on weird mathematical glyphs; and it is surprisingly elegant.
History of Old Wizardy APL is a quite old language. It started as a book (under the same name) written by Kenneth Eugene Iverson in 1962. The focus of the book was mathematical notation. Ken was dissatisfied with the inconsistency of mathematical notation and the lack of a sufficient tool to describe computer algorithms especially when it comes to matrices.</description></item></channel></rss>
