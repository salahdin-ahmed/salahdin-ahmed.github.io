We don&amp;rsquo;t really engage, have fun, or learn. You waste hours of your life doing nothing but scroll through an endless stream of meaningless content. Human lives should be wasted on nothing like this. I won&amp;rsquo;t be talking about why to leave, you are here because you already want to leave.
Why it&amp;rsquo;s so hard to leave It is no secret that social media companies improve their products every single day.</description></item></channel></rss>
