People hate, avoid, and even fight it, but no matter the struggle with that edifice, it will devour you and everyone close to your heart. You will have—even if you hate to—accept it.
My philosophy, on the other hand, is to embrace it; make it an irreplaceable ingredient in your daily life. Start every morning with talking to death, plan your day as if it is with you, and sleep every night while perceiving it.</description></item></channel></rss>
